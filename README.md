# Decentralized Lottery Smart Contract

## Overview
This project implements a decentralized lottery smart contract that allows players to enter a raffle and have a chance to win the accumulated prize pool. The lottery is fully on-chain, with no centralized authority controlling the process. The winner is randomly selected using a secure, verifiable method.

## Key Features
### Decentralized Lottery: 
The entire lottery process, from accepting entries to selecting the winner, is handled by a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. There is no central party controlling the lottery.
### Secure Random Number Generation: 
The winning number is generated in a transparent, verifiable way using a combination of on-chain and off-chain random sources to ensure fairness.
### Provable Fairness: 
Players can independently verify that the winner selection process is fair and unbiased.
### Flexible Entry Mechanism: 
Players can easily enter the lottery by sending the required entry fee to the smart contract.
### Automated Prize Distribution: 
Once the winner is determined, the prize is automatically transferred to their wallet, eliminating the need for manual payouts.

## How It Works
### Entry: 
Players send the required entry fee to the smart contract to participate in the lottery.
### Random Number Generation: 
The smart contract uses a combination of on-chain and off-chain random sources to generate a secure, verifiable random number.
### Winner Selection: 
The smart contract selects the winner by comparing the generated random number to the ticket numbers.
### Prize Distribution: 
The winning player's wallet receives the accumulated prize pool.

## Getting Started
To use the decentralized lottery smart contract, follow these steps:
### Deploy the Smart Contract: 
Deploy the provided Solidity smart contract to your preferred blockchain network.
### Fund the Prize Pool: 
Send the desired amount of funds to the smart contract's address to build up the prize pool.
### Enter the Lottery: 
Send the required entry fee to the smart contract's address to participate in the lottery.
### Wait for the Draw: 
The smart contract will periodically select a winner using the secure random number generation process.
### Claim the Prize: 
The winning player can claim their prize by interacting with the smart contract.

## Technical Details
The smart contract is written in Solidity and follows best practices for security and gas optimization. It uses a combination of on-chain and off-chain random sources, including the block timestamp and a third-party random number service, to generate the winning number in a verifiable way.
The contract's source code and deployment instructions are available on GitHub.
